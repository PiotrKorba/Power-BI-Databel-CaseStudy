# Power BI Case Study: Analyzing Churn Rates for Databel

This Power BI case study is based on a DataCamp course "Case Study: Analyzing Customer Churn in Power BI" from "Data Analyst in Power BI" career track. Although the basis of the whole project is the content from the mentioned course, I added a lot of my own. The entire design of the final five pages of the report, along with the selection of appropriate color palettes, is 100% my own initiative. It looks very similar when it comes to for example, overwriting the database regarding states, which originally loaded incorrectly, or with a large number of smaller or larger corrections that I made when creating the report.
